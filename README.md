## _Web Developer_

Have you wondered, how do websites like Youtube or Google work? They don't magically appear online but instead, someone is in charge of writing the website code and handling its data. That's the job of web developers!

A web developer is responsible for programming and maintaining the functionality of online websites and web applications. Web Developers often dictate a website’s feel and look in addition to its technical side. Web Developers will typically specialize in either the “front-end” (“client-side”) development or “back-end” (“server-side”) development. However, versatile and sought-after professionals, referred to as “Full Stack Developers,” will do both. 

Web Developers are also responsible for:

* Collaborating with graphic designers for designs monitor website traffic
* Troubleshooting website problems
* Making frequent updates on websites

## _Required education_

* Computer Science Degree (Bachelors)
* Although not required, but highly recommended, a certificate in web development and data management (For Full Stack Developers)

## _Required technical and non-technical skills_

| Technical Skils | Non-Technical SKills |
| --------------- | --------------------- |
| Front-end: Being comfortable with using languages like JavaScript, HTML, CSS | Having constant interest in current trends and growth. |
| Backend: Having familiarity in Python, Java, SQL, NoSQL, and Git. | Strong communication and leadership skills (As you'll be mostly working within teams)|
| Knowledge of web servers and their functioning | Artistically inclined for front end and mathematically well off for backend data analysis. |
